This is a currently a placeholder introduction.


[PROJECT_NAME] is a python package designed to provide a virtual testing ground for multicopter Unmanned Arial Vehicles (UAV's) by modelling vehicle behaviour by using a state space model. 
It was created after I was unable to find an appropriate space to test aerodynamic properties of an airplane on my university campus. 
Currently, the package supports a single quadcopter format (X style, all motors equidistant from CoM), but will be updated to include various layouts, as well as other rotary wing formats such as helicopters, and eventually, fixed wing aircraft.
